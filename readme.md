# DIV Baller Shooter Thingy

Two divs, one static in place, the other moving from left to 
right. Inside each div is a canvas. I click anywhere in the canvas,
it creates a circle. I click outside the circle, it fires bullets. 
I click on the circle again, the circle is removed.

Inspired by this video I found somewhere on Reddit or so:
